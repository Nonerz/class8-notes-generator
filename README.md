# class8-notes-generator
This is a simple notes generator, which you can use to get notes of subjects like Maths, Physics, Chemistry, Biology, History and etc.





It is very straigh forward you enter a name of a subject and it brings all the notes of subjects that are coming for Annual exam.
Note that I DO NOT OWN ANY OF THE NOTES. I just made the application to find notes easier.


NO VIRUSES ARE THERE 
ITS A FALSE POSITIVE
